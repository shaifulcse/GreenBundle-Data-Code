GreenBundle: An Empirical Study on the Energy Impact of Bundled Processing.


Requirements for running the python scripts for drawing graphs:

1) Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS. But should work on other systems. 

2) Python 2.7.12

3) Matplotlib 2.0
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

4) Seaborn: it was used for calculating confidence interval with bootstrapping. 

One way to install seaborn:

sudo apt install python-pip
sudo -H pip2 install --upgrade pip
sudo pip2 install seaborn


It is important to note that all measurements are shared. So one can draw graphs using any library.
