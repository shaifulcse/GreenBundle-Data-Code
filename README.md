GreenBundle: An Empirical Study on the Energy Impact of Bundled Processing.

1) results:

   This directory contains all the measurement data and scripts to draw graphs for those data. 


   Requirements for running the python scripts for drawing graphs:

   i) Tested on Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS. But should work on other systems. 

   ii) Python 2.7.12

   iii) Matplotlib 2.0
   
   sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

   iv) Seaborn: it was used for calculating confidence interval with bootstrapping. 

   One way to install seaborn:

   sudo apt install python-pip

   sudo -H pip2 install --upgrade pip

   sudo pip2 install seaborn


It is important to note that all measurements are shared. So one can draw graphs using any library.
