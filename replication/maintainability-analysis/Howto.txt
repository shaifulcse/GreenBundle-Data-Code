To fully replicate the maintainability analysis from scratch you need two tools:  
1. Understand (scitools.com) 
2. DV8 (archdia.net)

Each of these is a commercial product, which is why we can not provide them in the replication package. However both of them offer free academic licenses.

The results presented in the ICSE 2019 paper "GreenBundle: An Empirical Study on the Energy Impact of Bundled Processing" 
are provided in the file All.DL.xlsx.  This file provides DL scores for each of the "Bundling" and 
"Original" versions of each of the four studied projects: SensorReadout, ColorPicker, Angulo, and AcrylicPaint.  

To replicate these results yourself you need to use Understand to scan the source files of each projecct.  For each project,
make sure that you scan the code in the app/src folder.  Understand will build its own database (a .udb file).  Once the 
source file tree has been scanned by Understand you need to output all file dependencies as a 
Cytoscape XML file (Reports | Dependency | File Dependencies | Export Cytoscape XML).

The Cytoscape XML file is the input to DV8.  Using the Cytoscape file you can use DV8 to: a) create a structure DSM and b) 
calculate the DL metric from the structure DSM.  This should result in the DL scores reported in All.DL.xlsx.
